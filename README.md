## 🧠 About Me

I’m a developer with 15+ years of experience building scalable, resilient web systems across various industries.  
My stack includes **Symfony (PHP), Node.js, React, TypeScript, .NET, and MySQL**, and I’ve worked across both frontend and backend — from corporate platforms to grassroots digital infrastructure.

I don’t just write code. I build ideas that challenge injustice and empower people.

## 🧩 What I Believe

> I don’t take sides in wars.  
> I believe in justice through code, not power through flags.  
> We need systems that reward action, not identity. That’s why I built [AMA](https://github.com/dritongit/ama).
